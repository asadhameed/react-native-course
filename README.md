Create a react-native project.

### 1 `npm install --save @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/native`

React Navigation is made up of some core utilities and those are then used by navigators to create the navigation structure in your app.

### 6 `npm install -g react-devtools`

This is a standalone app for debugging React Native apps.

1. Usage with React Native
   Run react-devtools from the terminal to launch the standalone DevTools app: `react-devtools`\
